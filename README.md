# Objective
I'd like ta create a gizoogle (http://gizoogle.net/) extension fo' Chrome... basically, it'll be a on/off switch fo' automatic gizooglin of every last muthafuckin thang

# Run local
1. Clone this repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable developer mode
4. Load unpacked extension...

# Use
1. Click Snoop to instantly gizoogle a site (currently doesn't work with authentication)
2. Click Snoop again to turn off

# TODO
- [x] Basic functionality
- [ ] Work wit authenticated sites (usin textilizer)
- [ ] Work betta wit tabs
  - gizoogle likes ta open every last muthafuckin thang up in freshly smoked up tabs yo, but dis aint tracked by dis extension
